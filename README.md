# 2016_Oregon_State_CS162_ComputerScienceII_FinalProject
The Final Project for my Computer Science II course taken at Oregon State University

This Program is a text-based game using Object Oriented Programming design principles in C++. It includes a Reflection Document / Project Summary detailing: design description, changes to the original design, and the test plan. Functionally, the user controlls a character that moves around inside of a 2D text-based set of rooms. These rooms are linked together by doors that point to other rooms. The user can pick up or drop objects into or from a limited inventory bag. The user can also affect his or her surrondings by flipping switches inside certain rooms.

Inside you will find:
  1.  Header Files
  2.  Implementation Files
  3.  A MakeFile for use in Linux
  4.  A Reflection Document
  
This program was initially written to be run in Windows but can be modified to run well in Linux. Simply implement the few changes listed at the end of the reflection document.
